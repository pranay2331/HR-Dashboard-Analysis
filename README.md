# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive HR Analytics dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee attrition within an organization. The dashboard provides insights into factors such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary brackets, and tenure that influence attrition. The goal is to help HR teams identify trends and take proactive steps to improve employee retention.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project includes the following key features:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Education Field, and more.
- **Job Details**: Job Role, Department, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, and Over Time.
- **Attrition Factors**: Years at Company, Distance from Home, Relationship Satisfaction, and Attrition Status.

The data has been pre-processed to ensure quality and consistency for visualization purposes.

---

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Transformed categorical data into relevant fields for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Created new metrics such as `Attrition Rate`, `Salary Slabs`, and `Age Groups`.

3. Dashboard Design:
   - Built interactive charts and KPIs to highlight key insights.
   - Organized visualizations for clarity and ease of use.

---

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following:
- Power BI Desktop installed.
- The dataset file: `BI_project.xlsx`.
- A system with at least 4GB RAM for smooth rendering of visuals.

---

## How to Run
1. Download the `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix` file and the dataset (`BI_project.xlsx`) from this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Load the dataset when prompted.
4. Explore the interactive dashboard by applying filters and viewing different charts.

---

## Results
The dashboard provides the following insights:
1. **Key Metrics**: Overview of attrition rates, average salary, and tenure.
2. **Attrition Trends**: Insights into attrition based on education, age group, salary, job satisfaction, and tenure.
3. **Demographic Analysis**: Breakdown of attrition by gender and education fields.
4. **Job Satisfaction Insights**: Highlights roles and satisfaction levels most prone to attrition.

---

## Conclusions
1. Attrition is highest among employees aged 26-35 and those with lower salaries (up to 5K).
2. Employees in the `Life Sciences` education field and `Research Scientist` roles are more likely to leave.
3. Early tenure (0-2 years) is critical for retention efforts, as it sees the most attrition.

Proactive measures such as improving job satisfaction, offering competitive salaries, and engaging employees during their early tenure can help reduce attrition.
